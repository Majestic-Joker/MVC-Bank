<p>
    Thank you for checking out my bank app, I appreciate your time. Feel free to use any fictional email to
    create an account and explore: bob@something.com and variations of will work just fine.

    To use the transfer funds feature, i suggest creating two accounts as you'll need the account number in 
    order to be able to transfer funds to it.

    My contact information is on the contact page if you'd like to reach out to me with opportunities.
